- Hi, I’m @corgito aka Nicolai

- My areas of expertise include machine learning, natural language processing, and all things data and Python. 
- I have a passion for crafting elegant solutions, whether it's something as simple as [fixing the timestamps in a text file](https://nhaddal.info/blog/vtt/) or as complex as [surveying the social media landscape on critical programs like Social Security](https://unfilteredmedia.substack.com/p/what-ai-powered-social-content-analysis).
